Next steps:

- Write all of the special attack methods
- Figure out how I'm going to implement special attacks
    - Likely want to have some form of raw DPS (assuming the spec is a normal attack)
    - Also want to have integration of specs into a fight, accounting for spec regen and different spec strategies
- Write a simple two-way fight simulation for monsters with a single attack style
    - Port the wiki calc's NPCVsPlayerCalc code to here
    - Write some tests ensuring that the NPC DPS is getting the expected results
    - Decide on a method of using "configs" for simulations
- Write generalized methods for monsters with multiple attack styles (assume equal chance of each style)
- Begin writing more specialized simulations:
    - GWD bosses
        - Zilyana is an easy place to start, as I wouldn't have to account for any boss attacks or mechanics - just minion damage
        - Graardor and K'ril are also fairly simple, though they introduce the possibility of different strategies (red-x vs. melee, in particular)
        - Kree is relatively simple if avoiding chins, but chins are important to be able to include
    - Demonic gorillas
        - Introduces the concept of switches
        - Fairly simple to implement otherwise
    - Rune dragons
        - Good example of a monster with multiple attacks but no difficult mechanics
        - Relevant due to their prevalance as an AFK moneymaker
    - Addy and mithril dragons (by extension)
    - Vorkath
        - Introduces more attack styles - would want to gather more data on the frequency of different styles
        - Otherwise, it's a highly scripted fight that would be reasonably simple to simulate
    - Zulrah
        - A good use case for simulation because of the different phases, switches, down time, etc.
        - Would require some research and data collection to determine exact timings
        - There's an existing simulation (in Rust!) to reference, but it may not be 100% accurate
        - Has a *lot* of different strategies that can be implemented—would require research to fully understand them all
    - Corrupted Hunllef
        - Simple in terms of gear and switches, but introduces some different strategy choices
        - Very relevant and high-demand given how many people do this boss and blame stats/RNG
        - There's an existing simulator in Rust that I can reference here as well—likely needs refining
    - Vardorvis
        - Already started doing some research and data collection about timings and different mechanics
        - Seems to have some element of randomness but doesn't have a lot of mechanics to implement
    - Muspah
        - Not sure how phases work here—would need more research
        - Fairly simple mechanics, except for the prayer shield (would have to implement sapphire bolts and corruption)
    - Cerberus
        - Pretty well-understood fight that should be fairly straightforward to implement (possible exception of ghosts)
    - Leviathan
        - Consistent fight overall, but might require some branching paths depending on smoke barrage timings
    - Calvar'ion/Vet'ion
        - Very simple fight—only complexity is around hellhound spawn timings and any forced downtime
    - Callisto/Artio
        - Need to learn more about this fight, but shouldn't be too bad
    - Spindel/Venenatis
        - See above
    - Moons of Peril
        - Made more difficult by the uniqueness of their mechanics and the lack of visibility of stacks
        - Fairly well researched, though, so it should be possible to simulate them
    - Thermy
        - Probably a very simple fight to simulate? I'm not very experienced with it
    - Hydra
        - Likely straightforward—would just require research for exact timings
    - GGs
        - Has potential to be tricky, depending on how much freedom I want to give for strategies
        - Could start off with a rigid approach to simplify things
    - Kraken
        - Extremely simple, probably one of the easiest
    - Sire
        - Again, would require some data collection for timings
        - Probably difficult to properly simulate the minion spawns and evolutions, but might be doable with research
    - KQ
        - Fairly simple—requires knowing the down time between phases
        - Might be more complex if adding in kalphite guardians
        - Definitely some room for strategies here—step-unders, venging, etc.
    - Sarachnis
        - Reasonably straightforward fight—main difficulty would be in accurately recreating lost ticks from webs

- Difficult simulations (reach goals):
    - Raids
        - Probably can't simulate full raids—or if I do, it will be with manually inputted or approximated non-boss times
        - Can probably start with simulating individual rooms of each raid
        - Then, can do individual phases of final bosses, which can then be pieced together
        - Will probably have to assume solo raids for now (except for ToB)
        - CoX
            - Simpler rooms:
                - Tekton (assuming perfect dodging—main thing is anvil timing and regen)
                - Shamans (assuming one at a time with perfect dodging)
                - Guardians
                - Mystics (again, assuming one at a time with tanking—maybe implement safespotting)
                - Ice demon (just the fight)
                - Tightrope (one at a time, tanking—could even implement tank top/bottom switching on rangers)
            - More complex rooms:
                - Vasa (timing and damage mechanics of teleport attack, switching, healing during crystal)
                - Vanguards (having to take into account the thresholds and how strategy is adjusted accordingly)
                - Muttadiles (timing of big and little ones, dealing with chopping vs. freezing, general jankiness of mechanics)
                - Vespula (properly implementing the redemption strat, especially with prayer enhances)
            - Olm
                - Mage hand is simple—just need to account for lost ticks to DWH spec(s) and potentially the choice between tanking a hit or running to the far side to skip
                - Melee hand isn't that much more complicated if you assume perfect 4:1 with perfect acid walk, flame wall null, etc.
                    - Gets more complicated if taking into account 
                        - whatever damage is unavoiadable during an acid walk
                        - doing world scythe or 7:3 (or any other more complex method)
                - Need to determine timing between phases
                - P3 should probably include the ability to do 4:0 as well - would need to do more research/practice myself
                - Head phase is probably easy if you assume no unnecessary damage is taken, but it will almost always be an optimistic result
        - ToB
            - Frankly, I need to learn ToB myself and really dive into the mechanics of each room to do this properly
            - Probably would want to consult or work with ToB experts
            - May not be feasible to provide the level of customization and depth that people doing ToB would want
            - Is made much more complex by the need to simulate team play, which may just be too complicated
        - ToA
            - Zebak is probably the simplest room, since you have basically no downtime outside of shooting jugs
            - Ba-Ba is also reasonably simple, with the main things being timings for boulders and whether you're doing red-x or 5:1
            - Akkha seems more complicated but may actually be simple outside of the last phase (hard to account for lost ticks)
            - Kephri is difficult because of the swarms/shield regen and the scarabs—how do you accurately recreate that in a sim?
            - Wardens:
                - P1 is dead simple - pretty much the only complexity is from how and when you heal back the damage 
                - P2 is more complicated - the damage formula is still not completely known, and would have to provide different options for core strategies
                - P3 and P4 are very simple, since the time loss from skulls should be consistent and you can take no damage with optimal play
    - Nex
        - Similar to ToB in that it is made difficult by requiring a team and having a lot of potential optimizations/strats
        - These types of team simulations would be an entirely different beast, but could be a fun stretch goal
    - PNM/solo NM
        - Probably not *that* difficult compared to Nex or raids, but I'm not familiar with the mechanics
        - Group NM would have the same types of problems as Nex or ToB


Long-term aspirations:

- Create some sort of user interface - preferably a web GUI (WASM if possible), but could be a standalone app
    - CLI or TUI would be a decent place to start and a good option to have
- Look at implementing loot rolls/drop simulators for fun
- Could look at simulating continuous trips with banking, etc. to simulate kph and/or slayer xp/hr
- Gear optimizer (probably not going to happen, but would be cool and is clearly in high demand)
